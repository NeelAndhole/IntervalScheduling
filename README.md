# IntervalScheduling
This contains an asymtotically optimal solution to the interval scheduling problem using a greedy strategy under the finishes first heuristic.
The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of jobs. For each job, there will be a pair of
positive integers i and j, where i â‰¤ j, and i is the start time, and j is the end time.
